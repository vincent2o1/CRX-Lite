# CRX-Lite
CRX-Lite is a novel, simplified approach designed to test my theory of BrainX and the original CRX. Recreating the full theory is computationally expensive and a lengthy process; moreover, it's not necessary to mimic nature's construction exactly. Just as we built calculators instead of robotic hands to perform calculations, CRX-Lite acts as a simplified tool. This model comprises two systems: a focusing agent, analogous to an eye, and a ring tree, which stores incoming information. CRX-Lite focuses solely on storage and retrieval. What you're seeing is the first stage of an information processing system, specifically, the retrieval of stored information
# Focusing agent
This agent gets the bits of information from the input source and stores it in sequence.This storage of sequence is what we call the 'smallest truth,' a learned feature of any input. Because the smallest truth is an emergent, inherent property of an information processing system during organizing and testing this function was called to confirm the activated nodes to whether present in the input source or not. if present the model continues giving outputs, of not found then model halts the process. this process is called dual process.

# Ring tree
the successful patterns/ID gets stored in a comman directory where ring tree can access these stored files and organize them in a ring tree structure, and assists in **storage**, **retrieval**, **removal of stored unwanted information**

> for now we will go with training and testing method separately for easier checking the performance of the model. after the good performance, we will merge the training and testing into one process - the attention process
STORAGE - On training, the Ring tree function takes a successful patterns and organize them in a ring tree structure
RETRIEVAL - on testing, the model takes the input signals and retrieves the stored information
REMOVAL OF STORED INFORMATION - the ring tree function inherently works on cleaning the stored unwanted process. it does this process automatically.

**DETAILS ABOUT THE RING TREE**
*General rules*
*   if branched, the dual process should get more info to confirm the path to travel
*  searcher should get more input (atleast 5) to confirm the ring tree specificity to the input.
*   initially give 2 outputs for each confirmation of nodes with the input, after confrimation happens for 3 consecutive nodes, increase the output number to 4.
---
*Specific rules*
1. storage of ring tree - should be sequentially one by one. output should be given by travelling down the tree
---
2. branching - only if present in main root.
*   should check for atleast 3 rings similarity to the 3 consecutive inputs to confirm that main root ring to create as branch.
*   if atleast 5 rings are same then directy create connection within the main root, no need of branch.
---
3. insertion of new ring - only if not present in main root + not found when cross-ring connection
---
4. cross ring connection - only if donar ring tree is activated by input source. each activated ring from donar ring tree should be taken for testing similarity with the receiver ring tree activated leftalone ring to find a good match and then proceed with the receiver ring tree processing. leave the donar tree
---
5. dual process - should actively communicate with focusing agent to gather additional input
---
**TRAINING** - feeds all the piece of information into the model.
---
**ORGANIZING** - Organizes the incoming already familiar information within the ring tree netork
---
**TESTING** - a function that enables comprehensive traversal of interconnected 'ring trees' based on incoming input and external confirmation via focusing agent.
